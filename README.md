## Features

- **Sensors and Heartbeat Monitor**: The chest is equipped with sensors that monitor your environment and physiological state. For instance:
  - **LCD Screen and Speaker**: The screen uses a potentiometer to ask for user ratings for certain questions, such as whether they exercised today. The speaker rewards the user with a statement at the end.
  - **Heartbeat Sensor**: Monitors stress levels and overall health. If your heart rate spikes due to anxiety or distraction, Focus-Box intervenes.
  
- **Timer Mechanism**: The chest operates on a timer. When you set a specific work or focus duration, Focus-Box locks itself. During this time, distractions are inaccessible. Only when the timer expires does the chest open, granting access to your devices.

- **Health Check-In**: Focus-Box isn’t just about productivity; it’s about holistic well-being. Regularly, the chest prompts you to place your hand on the heartbeat sensor, assessing your stress levels and encouraging mindfulness breaks.
